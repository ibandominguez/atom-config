This adds the ability to complete HTML tags by pressing \"cmd-opt-.\" This package also has the ability to close tags within the line you are on if an open tag is detected but not a close tag.\n\nCurrently, this only evaluates the line that the cursor is on.\n\nNext steps will include multi-line evaluation, better handling of specific elements.\n\nPlace this in your Atom packages directory: ~/.atom/packages/\n\nVersion 0.2.x switches to using regular expressions to identify open/closed HTML elements.\n\n# Issues\n\nThis is still in development, so it might occasionally complete the tag wrong, or \"fix\" a tag on your line that doesn't need to be fixed. Please let me know of any issues you run into and I will fix them!\n",
